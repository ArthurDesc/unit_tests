# Unit Tests Project

A project for practicing unit testing techniques.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the tests:
```bash
npm test
```

3. Run tests in watch mode (for development):
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code
  - `*.ts`: TypeScript implementation files
  - `*.test.ts`: Test files for corresponding implementations

## Testing Guidelines

- Each function should have its own test suite
- Tests should cover normal cases, edge cases, and error cases
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
